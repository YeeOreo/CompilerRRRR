ç·¨è­¯å™¨å™¨å™¨å™¨å™¨

This a final semester project of the course, Compiler.

## Simple installation tutorial ðŸ“–

For gcc, you can install wxDev-C++ version 7.4.2 to get this gcc from this:

> http://wxdsgn.sourceforge.net/

In website, choose the tab, "download"

In the tab page, "download", choose the download option, "wxDev-C++ Full Installer" to download.

Note that the installation could not including space.

After the installation completed, you need to set the environment variable.
                                                          
In System Variable, choose the Path option and insert Your installation location.

At last, you need to run wxDevC++ to get the linking library. (they will show up in the following steps)

First of all, wxDevC++ will ask you to set the First-Run Configuration, Choose the language you are using.

Second, tick the "Yes, I want to use this feature".

Other configuration can keep the default.

--- 

For Flex, you can install from thisï¼š

> http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/flex.htm

In website, choose the download option, "Complete package, except sources" to download.

Note that the installation could not including space

---

For Bison, you can install from thisï¼š

> http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/bison.htm

In website, choose the download option, "Complete package, except sources" to download.

The installation location should be identical to Flex's. 

Note that the installation could not installation space

After the installation completed, you need to set the environment variable.
                                                          
In System Variable, choose the Path option and insert Your installation location.

---

Copy Linking Library

The linking library will show up after you complete First-Run Configuration of wxDev-C++.

Copy the 3 files of the directory "lib" that under the Flex's and Bison's root location.

Paste in the directory MinGW32\lib that under the wxDev-C++'s root location.

---
Testing installation results

type the script as followed 

(Note that v is case-sensitive)
```
gcc -v
```
The version should be 4.6.1

The COLLECT_LTO_WRAPPER location should under the directory of wxDev-C++'s location.

(If not, may be the wrong version of gcc being caught)

```
flex -V
```
The version should be 2.5.4
```
bison -V
```
The version should be 2.4.1

# Introduction âš¡
A "calculator" implemented with the Lex and Bison(Yacc's GNU version).

This calculator including Arithmetic Expression which can have operations Such likeï¼š
1. Addition 
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication
4. Division

Also supportï¼š
1. Modulus 
2. Round brackets

## API Functions ðŸ—ºï¼š

> Basic Mathematical Functions

\+

\-

\*

/

%

> Constant

piï¼š3.1415926

> Trigonometric functionsï¼š

sin()

cos()

tan()

> Floor and ceiling functions

ceil() = uGuass

uGuass() = ceil()

floor() = lGuass()

lGuass() = floor()

> Other Mathematical Functions

abs()ï¼šAbsolute value.

sqrt()ï¼šSquare root.

log()ï¼šThe logarithm of X to base 10.

ln()ï¼šThe logarithm of X to base 2.

exp()ï¼šNatural logarithm.

## Usage(on Windows Command Prompt)ï¼š
```
flex calculator_trail.l
```
> It should produces lex.yy.c
```
bison -d Calculator.y
```
> It should produces Calculator.tab.h and Calculator.tab.c
```
gcc -o Calculator Calculator.tab.c lex.yy.c -lfl
```
> It should produces Calculator.exe
```
./Calculator.exe
```
> It starts to run the calculator.

> You can type any Arithmetic expression on terminal.

## Usage_2(on Windows Command Prompt)ï¼š

We create a windows batch file to simply the process of compiling and executing.
```
compile_and_run.bat Calculator
```
> It should produces Calculator.tab.h, Calculator.tab.c, lex.yy.c and Calculator.exe.

> Next it starts to run the calculator.

> You can type any Arithmetic expression on terminal.

# Examples ðŸ–©
> (You can use Pure_input.txt to enter into Terminal to see the results and you can see the details of Pure_input from DEMO_input.txt)

Here are examples that will cause error.

When an error occurred, the calculator will be terminated.
